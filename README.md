# Branching

It will be essential that everyone create a separate branch when working on different pieces of this project. YOU SHOULD NEVER BE ON THE ORIGIN BRANCH AND YOU SHOULD NEVER BE PUSHING TO THE ORIGIN BRANCH.
Keep track of branches and what you are working on using the BRANCH.md

# CHEAT SHEET FOR BRANCHING (See Resources for more depth)
